# nucleosome_dna

The Matlab function seq2nucleosome_grad_descent.m finds  
an optimal DNA configuration on a nucleosome
for a given sequence S, by minimising the cgDNA+ model energy
subject to constraints on the phosphate positions.

Input:

S    - any chosen DNA sequence of length 147.
       For example: S = randseq(147);

Output:

wopt - optimal configuration on a nucleosome for the sequence S;
U    - potential (free) energy, needed to deform DNA sequence S
       into the configuration wopt. 

Example of usage:

S = randseq(147);
[U, wopt] = seq2nucleosome_grad_descent(S);
